    Conventional economic models often treat money as neutral: it moves prices but does not determine real activity.
    Credit, if considered at all, is usually described as a secondary friction rather than as something central.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yet in practice, <strong>credit operates as a de facto licence</strong>.
    Access to credit decides which projects go ahead, and in that sense,
    <strong>credit criteria determine what and who is licensed to shape the future</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This system contributed to the creation of modern prosperity by 
    steering resources to where they could be used most efficiently. 
    At the same time, because credit criteria rarely included environmental considerations, 
    financial wealth expanded through the overuse of natural resources, and has produced 
    unbalanced growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    That tension creates a structural trap: as long as credit targets financial returns alone,
    ecological overuse is built into the system. Rebalancing the credit agreement
    so that it also requires restoration could shift how the productive economy organises itself.

    We tested what this might mean in the agricultural sector,
    and how it could inform a re-envisioning of what agri-lenders might look like in a 
    sustainable future and even <a href="https://github.com/eco-credit/open-impact-earth" target="_blank">built an open-source management 
      information system to power this future lender.</a>
