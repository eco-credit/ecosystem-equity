    Conventional economic models often treat money as neutral: it moves prices but does not determine real activity.
    Credit, if considered at all, is usually described as a secondary friction rather than as something central.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yet in practice, <strong>credit operates as a de facto licence.</strong> 
    Access to credit decides which projects are resourced and go ahead. 
    In that sense, <strong>credit criteria and the committees that apply them determine what 
    and who is licensed to shape the future</strong>. 
    The credit process is therefore fundamental in determining our trajectory towards or away from sustainability.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whilst this system helped create modern prosperity by steering resources to 
    where they could create most financial return, 
    credit criteria rarely accounted for environmental limits. 
    As a result, financial wealth expanded through the overuse of natural resources, 
    leading to unbalanced growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    This imbalance is in fact a systemic structural flaw: as long as credit targets financial returns alone, 
    ecological overuse is built into the system. Rebalancing the credit agreement
    so that it also requires restoration could shift how the productive economy organises itself.

    We tested what this might mean in the agricultural sector,
    and how it could inform a re-envisioning of what agri-lenders might look like in a 
    sustainable future and even <a href="https://github.com/eco-credit/open-impact-earth" target="_blank">built an open-source management 
      information system to power this future lender.</a>
