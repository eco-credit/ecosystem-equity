  <h2>Problem Definition</h2>

  <h3>At the start of the project, we defined the problem in financial terms</h3>
  <p>
    Environmental management is hard to scale because few want to or are able to meet its full cost. 
    Soil, forest, and biodiversity investments take years to yield returns, and may never do so: 
    costs are real and immediate, benefits are future and speculative. 
    These factors contribute to a conservation 
    <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/Sustainability/Our%20Insights/Taking%20conservation%20finance%20to%20scale/Taking-conservation-finance-to-scale.pdf" 
       target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"finance gap"</a> 
    of $300 billion a year. The reality is that people will not or 
    cannot meet the short-term costs of maintaining sustainable environmental systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    We found a striking parallel which drove the point “home”. In housing, owners 
    expect to spend 1-4 percent of a home’s 
    value each year on upkeep. Without it, the asset deteriorates. 
    In one sense at least, environmental systems are no different: 
    neglect drives greater costs into the future. 
    And the parallel between our houses and our wider home is hard to overlook.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Beyond the Finance Gap</h3>
  <p>
    With time, we started to ask whether defining the problem in terms of finance gaps 
    may be unhelpful. 
    It frames the problem as a shortage of money for environmental protection and restoration, 
    and pushes us to look for new funding streams, rather than asking the question about how 
    productive 
    systems are organised. Simply filling the gap without rethinking production means running down 
    one natural resource to pay for another. A system where oil and gas projects fund sustainable 
    farming via the tax system appears illogical. 
    
  </p>
  <p>
    In terms of the "home" metaphor, we're dismantling the house itself to pay for its upkeep, 
    and still falling short. Closing the finance gap without fixing where the funds come 
    from drains one non-fungible resource to patch another. It may work on paper, but not in practice.

  </p>
  
  
  <h3>A Broader Understanding</h3>
  <p>
  Ecosystem Equity focuses on credit design as both a source of unsustainability and a means to overcome it. 
  However, with a focus on farming in implementing pilot projects, 
  we encountered over 50 more drivers and barriers (this list is available  
  <a href="docs/barriers.xlsx" target="_blank">here</a>), which often interact in locally 
  specific and unpredictable ways. While it’s challenging to see how these barriers can be 
  recognised and addressed all at once, toolkits are developing that can be deployed with 
  greater precision to meet the many impediments to sustainable resource use. 
</p>

<p>
  Within these many challenges, one issue is hard to avoid: 
  how society decides which projects and activities receive permission and resources to 
  shape the future. That decision is fundamental. But where that decision sits is, remarkably, 
  contentious. Banks, and the now defunct Green Financial Alliance for Net Zero, 
  <a href="https://flow.db.com/more/esg/how-banks-contribute-to-cop-26" target="_blank">say governments must regulate</a>, 
  while <a href="https://www.bis.org/review/r191029a.htm" target="_blank">central banks push back on a regulatory agenda</a>. 
  Is the question about what the future looks like – sustainable or unsustainable – 
  embedded in the capital allocation mechanism, or in state regulation of economic activity?
</p>

<p>
  Within this deadlock, Ecosystem Equity has sought a third path: asking whether 
  environmental sustainability can deliver financial returns by strengthening environmental 
  resilience and lowering borrowers’ credit risk. This idea proved especially relevant in the farming sector, where we conducted our pilots, 
  and has helped us re-envisage what an agri-lender might look like in a sustainable future, 
  as home to a rebalanced credit and capital allocation mechanism for food systems.
